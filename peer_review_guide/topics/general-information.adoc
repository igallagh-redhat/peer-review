[[peer-review-definition]]
=== Peer review definition

*Peer review covers:*

* Editorial clarity, correctness, and consistency of technical terminology. For more information about documentation conventions, see link:TODO[FAQ about style in CCS].
+
//The Documentation Conventions project aims to create a central document that outlines conventions for technical terminology and Red Hat product-specific naming that will be used by all of the CCS documentation tea  ms

* Structural clarity, focus, and completeness of information from the customer's perspective. This can come from the Minimalism framework, and can be something that applies only to reviews from within your product team. For more information on the minimalism initiative, see link:TODO[the Minimalism quality initiative]. This initiative works on gathering training information about minimalism.

* Modular structure, focus, and completeness of writing and information from the writer's perspective. This can come from the modular documentation project. For more information on the modular documentation project, see the link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/[Modular Documentation Reference Guide]. This project works on gathering training information about the modular documentation project.

*Peer review does not cover:*

* Technical accuracy in the sense of ”this represents the realities of the product being documented,” not technical verification.
+
// Add a definition of technical accuracy here, if needed?
